# The Shattered Realms RPG - Design Overview

## Project Summary
**The Shattered Realms** is a text-based RPG set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world where reality itself was shattered into floating islands. Players take on the role of a "Resonance Walker" - a rare individual who can manipulate multiple types of magical crystals without corruption.

## Core Game Pillars

### 1. Meaningful Choice and Consequence
- Player decisions affect not just immediate outcomes but long-term story progression
- Multiple branching paths lead to different endings
- Political and moral choices impact relationships and available options

### 2. Rich World-Building
- Detailed lore explains the current state of the world and its history
- Each island has unique culture, challenges, and opportunities
- Environmental storytelling through ruins, crystal formations, and NPC interactions

### 3. Interconnected Systems
- Magic system tied to world lore and gameplay mechanics
- Character progression reflects story choices and magical corruption
- Political relationships affect available quests and resources

## Planned Gameplay Systems

### 1. Crystal Resonance Magic System
- **6 Crystal Types**: Fire, Ice, Life, Shadow, Storm, Mind
- **Attunement Mechanics**: Risk/reward system for using multiple crystal types
- **Corruption System**: Overuse leads to negative consequences
- **Crafting Integration**: Combine crystals for unique effects

### 2. Turn-Based Combat System
- **Action Economy**: Multiple actions per turn based on character build
- **Positioning**: Tactical movement affects combat effectiveness
- **Environmental Hazards**: Use terrain and crystal formations strategically
- **Party Dynamics**: Ally relationships affect combat coordination

### 3. Reputation and Relationship System
- **Faction Standing**: Reputation with each island and major organization
- **Personal Relationships**: Individual NPC relationship tracking
- **Political Consequences**: Alignment affects available story paths
- **Romance Options**: Deep character relationships with story impact

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Systems (Tasks 2-3)
- Character creation and stat system
- Basic combat mechanics
- Crystal magic framework

### Phase 2: World Systems (Tasks 4-5)
- Inventory and equipment system
- Quest framework and dialogue system
- Island exploration mechanics

### Phase 3: Integration (Task 6)
- Main game loop and save system
- User interface and menu systems
- Balancing and polish

### Phase 4: Documentation (Task 7)
- Player documentation and guides
- Developer documentation for extensions
- Testing framework and bug tracking

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
- Each system designed to be independently testable
- Clear interfaces between different game components
- Easy to extend with new content or features

### 2. Narrative Integration
- Gameplay mechanics reinforce story themes
- Mechanical choices have narrative consequences
- World-building serves gameplay purposes

### 3. Player Agency
- Multiple valid approaches to every major challenge
- Player choices shape character development
- No single "correct" path through the story

## Key Design Documents
1. **world_design.md**: Detailed world-building, geography, and magic system
2. **narrative_structure.md**: Story outline, character arcs, and branching paths
3. **characters_and_lore.md**: Character profiles, cultural details, and historical background

## Success Metrics
- **Completable Story**: Player can reach at least one satisfying ending
- **Meaningful Choices**: Player decisions visibly impact the game world
- **Replayability**: Different choices lead to meaningfully different experiences
- **World Coherence**: All systems and story elements feel connected and logical

## Next Steps
With the world design completed, the next priority is implementing the core character and combat systems. This will require:
1. Defining character attributes and progression mechanics
2. Creating the combat system framework
3. Implementing the crystal magic system
4. Building the basic game loop structure

The detailed design documents provide the foundation for consistent implementation across all game systems.
