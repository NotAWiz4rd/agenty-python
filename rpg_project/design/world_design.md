# The Shattered Realms - World Design Document

## Overview
The Shattered Realms is a fantasy world that exists in the aftermath of the "Great Sundering" - a cataclysmic event that tore reality itself into floating islands connected by magical bridges of light called "Ethereal Paths."

## Core Setting Concept
- **Time Period**: Post-apocalyptic high fantasy (500 years after the Great Sundering)
- **World State**: A collection of floating islands with varying climates and magical properties
- **Technology Level**: Medieval with magical augmentation
- **Magic System**: Crystal-based magic where crystalline formations hold residual power from the Sundering

## The Great Sundering - Historical Foundation
500 years ago, the world was whole. A powerful order of mages called "The Synthesis" attempted to merge all magical energies into a single, controllable force. The ritual backfired catastrophically, shattering the world into fragments that now float in an ethereal void.

### Consequences of the Sundering:
1. **Physical**: The world broke into floating islands of various sizes
2. **Magical**: Magic became unstable, concentrated in crystal formations
3. **Ecological**: Each island developed unique environmental properties
4. **Social**: Civilizations were scattered, leading to isolation and cultural drift

## Major Regions (Islands)

### 1. Aethros - The Crown Isle
- **Description**: The largest central island, seat of the reformed government
- **Environment**: Temperate highlands with floating crystal formations
- **Population**: Mixed races, primarily humans and high elves
- **Government**: The Council of Remnants (representatives from major islands)
- **Key Features**: The Great Library (pre-Sundering knowledge), Ethereal Path nexus

### 2. Vorthak - The Forge Realm
- **Description**: A volcanic island rich in metals and fire crystals
- **Environment**: Volcanic with natural forges and lava flows
- **Population**: Primarily dwarves and fire-adapted beings
- **Culture**: Master craftsmen, builders of skyships and crystal-tech
- **Key Features**: The Eternal Forge, Crystal refineries

### 3. Sylvanos - The Living Isle
- **Description**: A lush, overgrown island where nature magic runs wild
- **Environment**: Dense forests with sentient plants and shifting landscapes
- **Population**: Elves, druids, and nature spirits
- **Culture**: Harmony with chaotic nature, oral traditions
- **Key Features**: The Heart Tree (massive living crystal tree), Singing Groves

### 4. Nethermoor - The Shadow Fragment
- **Description**: A dark, mist-shrouded island with necromantic energies
- **Environment**: Perpetual twilight, marshes, and haunted ruins
- **Population**: Undead, shadow creatures, and necromancers

### 5. Skyhold - The Floating Citadel
- **Description**: A mobile island-fortress that patrols the ethereal paths
- **Environment**: Artificial construct with minimal natural features
- **Population**: Elite sky knights and air elementals
- **Culture**: Military honor, protection of trade routes
- **Key Features**: The Wind Throne, Ethereal Path monitoring stations

## The Ethereal Paths
Bridges of pure magical energy that connect the islands. They shift and change based on magical currents, making travel unpredictable but possible.

### Types of Paths:
- **Stable Paths**: Permanent connections between major islands
- **Flux Paths**: Temporary connections that appear and disappear
- **Storm Paths**: Dangerous routes through magical storms
- **Hidden Paths**: Secret routes known only to select few

## Magic System: Crystal Resonance

### Core Principles:
1. **Crystal Types**: Different crystals channel different types of magic
2. **Resonance**: Magic users must attune to crystals to use their power
3. **Instability**: Overuse or misuse causes magical backlash
4. **Finite Resource**: Crystals slowly deplete with use

### Crystal Categories:
- **Flame Crystals** (Red): Fire magic, forging, heat manipulation
- **Frost Crystals** (Blue): Ice magic, preservation, cooling
- **Life Crystals** (Green): Healing, growth, nature magic
- **Shadow Crystals** (Purple): Illusion, necromancy, stealth
- **Storm Crystals** (Yellow): Lightning, weather, speed enhancement
- **Mind Crystals** (Clear): Telepathy, telekinesis, mental magic

## Threats and Conflicts

### 1. The Void Touched
Creatures and people corrupted by exposure to the raw void between islands. They seek to consume magic and spread the corruption.

### 2. The Synthesis Remnants
Surviving members of the order that caused the Sundering, still trying to "fix" their mistake through increasingly dangerous experiments.

### 3. Resource Wars
Islands fighting over limited magical crystals and ethereal path access.

### 4. The Fading
A mysterious phenomenon where islands slowly lose their magical cohesion and begin to dissolve into the void.

## Themes and Tone
- **Recovery and Rebuilding**: Civilization adapting to a broken world
- **Unity vs. Isolation**: Islands working together or remaining separate
- **The Price of Power**: Magic comes with costs and consequences
- **Hope in Darkness**: Finding light in a post-apocalyptic setting
- **Responsibility**: Dealing with the consequences of past actions

This world provides rich opportunities for adventure, moral complexity, and varied gameplay environments while maintaining internal consistency and compelling lore.
